High-Speed UART DMA Driver (uart_dma_driver)An AXI-Stream VHDL IP Core for High-Throughput Serial CommunicationThis is a high-speed, configurable UART VHDL IP core for FPGAs, built to interface directly with a Xilinx AXI DMA in Simple Interrupt Mode. It features a dual-clock architecture with integrated FIFOs, allowing the AXI and UART logic to operate in separate clock domains for maximum performance.Core Architecture: A Dual-Clock DesignThe driver acts as a robust bridge between the AXI system clock domain and the UART's serial clock domain. Integrated Clock-Domain Crossing (CDC) FIFOs ensure safe data buffering and transfer between the two.Transmit FlowAXI DMA (MM2S) --> [ TX FIFO (AXI Clock Domain) ] --> UART TX Logic (UART Clock Domain) --> External Pin
Receive FlowExternal Pin --> UART RX Logic (UART Clock Domain) --> [ RX FIFO (AXI Clock Domain) ] --> AXI DMA (S2MM)
